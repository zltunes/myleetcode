==========
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) is a famous programming training website for many IT practitioners to improve their coding skills and the ability to solve practical problems.

After I finished my training, I found there would be more and more people trying to use **Leetcode** to practise. So I just collect my experience on [my github](https://github.com/yyypasserby) in this [repo](https://github.com/yyypasserby/myleetcode) with **solutions** and some **analysis**. What I want is to share the solution with other programmers and find out more and more interesting and efficient algorithms.

What I also have done is in [leetcode_algorithm.json](https://yyypasserby.github.io/leetcode_algorithm.json), which is a json API for you to do some interesting things on it. If you need to get all the data on **Leetcode**, you don't need to crawl it again, just use this directly.

Again,

**Leetcode:** [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
